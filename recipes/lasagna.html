<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish known for its rich layers and comforting flavors. It typically consists of several layers of wide, flat pasta sheets (often referred to as lasagna noodles) alternated with layers of fillings. Here’s a detailed description of the components and preparation of a classic lasagna:</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Pasta Sheets: The foundation of the dish, these wide, flat noodles are usually pre-cooked or no-boil varieties.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Meat Sauce (Ragù): A hearty sauce made with ground meat (typically beef, pork, or a combination), tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs like oregano and basil. The meat is browned and then simmered with tomato sauce and seasonings.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Cheese: A mix of cheeses is used to add creaminess and flavor. Common cheeses include:</li>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Ricotta: A soft, creamy cheese often mixed with egg, parsley, and sometimes spinach.</li>
        <li>Mozzarella: Melts beautifully and adds a gooey texture.</li>
        <li>Parmesan: Adds a sharp, nutty flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>Bechamel Sauce (Optional): A creamy white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk. It is not always used in traditional recipes but can add a rich, velvety layer.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Tomato Sauce: Besides the meat sauce, additional tomato sauce is sometimes used to keep the dish moist and flavorful.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Sauces:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat Sauce: Brown the ground meat, then add onions, garlic, and cook until soft. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and season with herbs, salt, and pepper. Let it simmer to develop deep flavors.</li>
        <li>Bechamel Sauce: Melt butter in a saucepan, stir in flour to make a roux, then gradually whisk in milk until the sauce thickens.</li>  
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>Cook the Pasta Sheets: If using traditional lasagna noodles, cook them in boiling water until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Assemble the Lasagna:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of tomato or meat sauce at the bottom of a baking dish to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Lay down the first layer of pasta sheets.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of ricotta mixture, followed by meat sauce, a sprinkle of mozzarella, and a bit of Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers, ending with a top layer of pasta sheets.</li>
        <li>Cover the final layer with remaining sauce and a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>Bake</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil to prevent the top from burning.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven (usually around 375°F or 190°C) for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li>Rest and Serve:</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for about 15 minutes before slicing. This helps it set and makes it easier to serve neat slices.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
